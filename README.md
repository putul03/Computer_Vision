## Introduction to Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on enabling computers to interpret, understand, and process visual information from the world. It seeks to replicate human vision capabilities by using algorithms and models to analyze and extract meaningful information from images and videos. This field combines expertise from computer science, mathematics, machine learning, and image processing.

## Applications

Computer Vision finds applications in a wide range of industries and fields, including:

- **Medical Imaging:** Diagnosing diseases from medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Enabling self-driving cars to perceive and navigate the environment.
- ...

## Key Concepts

- **Image Processing:** Fundamental techniques for manipulating and enhancing images.
- **Feature Extraction:** Identifying relevant patterns and structures in images.
- ...

## Getting Started

1. **Programming Languages:** Familiarize yourself with languages like Python and libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
